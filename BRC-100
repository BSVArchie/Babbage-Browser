# üîê BRC-100 Authentication Overview

This document outlines the authentication process between BRC-100-compliant wallets and applications, emphasizing mutual trust, secure communication, and privacy-preserving identity management.

## üéØ Implementation Status

**Current**: Go-based BRC-100 implementation using bitcoin-sv/go-sdk
**Future**: May migrate to Rust for maximum performance and memory safety
**Timeline**: PoC in 2-3 weeks, production-ready with Go

## üß© Key Components

### 1. Mutual Authentication
- Both wallet and application verify each other's identity certificates.
- Identity certificates follow **BRC-52/103** standards, enabling **selective disclosure** ‚Äî users reveal only necessary identity data.
- Ensures both parties are trusted before initiating sensitive operations.

### 2. Type-42 Key Derivation (P2P Authentication)
- Wallet and app derive shared child keys using the **Type-42 scheme**.
- Enables secure, encrypted peer-to-peer channels.
- Shared secrets are used to encrypt messages and sign transactions.

### 3. BEEF Format & Atomic Transactions
- Transactions are constructed using **BEEF (Background Evaluation Extended Format)**.
- Ensures atomicity, integrity, and efficient data packaging.
- Wallet signs BEEF actions only after successful authentication.

### 4. SPV (Simplified Payment Verification)
- Verifies relevant blockchain data without downloading the full chain.
- Enables real-time validation of payments and identity proofs.
- Enhances speed and scalability for lightweight clients.

### 5. Authentication API Calls
- Wallet exposes APIs such as:
  - `isAuthenticated()` ‚Äî checks user‚Äôs authentication status.
  - `waitForAuthentication()` ‚Äî blocks until authentication is complete.
- Applications request identity certificates and validate them before proceeding.

### 6. Privacy & Security Enhancements
- Selective disclosure minimizes unnecessary data exposure.
- Certificate revocation and validation mechanisms maintain trust.
- Digital signatures and encryption protect message and transaction integrity.

## üîÑ Simplified Workflow

1. App requests the user‚Äôs identity certificate from the wallet.
2. Wallet provides a verifiable certificate with selective disclosure.
3. Both app and wallet derive shared keys using Type-42.
4. App constructs an atomic transaction (BEEF format) with identity context.
5. Wallet signs and returns the transaction.
6. App (or backend) verifies transaction and identity via SPV, then broadcasts.
7. Both parties confirm authenticated and secure session state.

## ‚úÖ Optional Enhancements

- **Session Expiry & Re-authentication**: Implement timeouts and re-auth triggers for long-lived sessions.
- **Certificate Pinning**: Cache trusted certificates to prevent MITM attacks.
- **Audit Trails**: Log authentication events for compliance and debugging.
- **Protocol Versioning**: Include protocol IDs (e.g., BRC-44/45/46) to support future upgrades.

## üêπ Go Implementation Notes

### bitcoin-sv/go-sdk Integration
- **BEEF Support**: Built-in BEEF format creation and verification
- **SPV Verification**: Simplified Payment Verification with BEEF
- **HD Wallet**: Hierarchical deterministic wallet support
- **Transaction Building**: Advanced transaction construction
- **Performance**: Compiled binary with excellent concurrency support

### Security Considerations
- **Process Isolation**: Go wallet runs in separate daemon process
- **Key Management**: Secure key derivation using PBKDF2
- **Memory Protection**: Private keys never leave Go daemon
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time type checking prevents many errors
- **Future Migration**: May consider Rust for maximum performance if needed
